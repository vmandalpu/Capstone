# Analysis of Nepal earthquake data
This project presents an analysis of data concerning the damages to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal. The data at our disposal are composed of 10000 observations, each representing a building. Each building is described by 40 features that are examined in this report. These attributes mainly consist of information on the buildingsâ€™ structure, use, localization and their legal ownership. 

As a first step, Data is explored by calculating summary and descriptive statistics, and by creating visualizations of the data. 

Finally, a predictive model to classify buildings into three level of damages was created.

This is a capstone project towards Microsoft Professional certification in Data Science. Finished the competition in top 5% of the students.
